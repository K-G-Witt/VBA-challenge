# VBA-Challenge

## Project Description:
The overall purpose of this project is to create and use a script using Visual Basic for Application (VBA) programming language to analyse trends in stock market data over three years: 2018, 2019, and 2020.
   
## Installation and Run Instructions:
This repository contains the following files:
1. **alphabetical_testing.xlsm:** a testing dataset saved as a macro-enabled Excel workbook.
2. **Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsm:** a validation dataset saved as a macro-enabled Excel workbook.
3. **VBA-Challenge_Script.txt:** the VBA script used to generate all analyses saved as a text file.

## Usage Instructions:
Executing the VBA script provided in the **VBA-Challenge_Script.txt** file will loop through all the stocks for each year in turn and will outputs the following information:
1. The ticker symbol;
2. Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year;
3. The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year, and;
4. The total stock volume of the stock.

Added functionality is also included in this VBA script to return, for each year, the stock with:
1. The "Greatest % increase";
2. The "Greatest % decrease", and;
3. The "Greatest total volume".
